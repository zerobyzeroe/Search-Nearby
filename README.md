# Search-Nearby Restaurants

An Efficient algorithm to find nearby restaurants around a query point in a query distance.

- Under the Guidance of Prof. Ashish Chiplunkar(Dept. of Computer Science)

- Given a dataset over 2D space, a query point and a query distance as an input
- Based on a given dataset over 2D space, identified the data points failing within a given rectangular query region of a point.
- Presented two distinct approaches: first, using k-D trees with O(n^(1-1/k)+m) time complexity and second, employing modified Range Trees with O(m+log^2(n)) time complexity.
- The given code file only contains the Range Trees solution.
- Providing diverse options for efficient data processing.

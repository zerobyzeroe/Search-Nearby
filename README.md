# Search-Nearby Restaurants

An Efficient algorithm to find nearby restaurants around a query point in a query distance.

Based on a given dataset over 2D space, identify the data points failing within a given rectangular query region of a point. - Presented two distinct approached: first, using k-D trees with O(n^(1-1/k)+m) time complexity and second, employing modified Range Trees with O(m+log^2(n)) time complexity, providing diverse options for efficient data processing.
